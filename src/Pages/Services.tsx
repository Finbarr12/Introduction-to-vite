              On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text,
              that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand
              times and everything that was left from its origin would be the
              word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return
              to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince
              her and so it didnâ€™t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers
              ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her
              into their agency, where they abused her for their.

              When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had
              a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove,
              the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road,
              the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek,
              then she continued her way.
